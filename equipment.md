Earth people have been making dumplings for as long as they have been growing food.  They didn't have steam ovens, blenders, or garlic presses, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't take advantage of what you've got.

Here is a list of stuff that could make your dumpling life easier.

## Mortar and Pestle ##

Get super-authentic if you like and import a [Molcajete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molcajete) to grind up your pumpkin seeds for your *tamal* dough.  But a ceramic one ought to do OK as well.  Our *mole* and *tamales* instructor Enrique at <a target="_blank" href="https://cookinvallarta.com">Cookin' Vallarta</a> says that yeah, you could use modern electric kitchen appliances to do your grinding and mashing and kneading and stuff.  But those devices eliminate a subtle ingredient from the entire process:  time.  That time is an often under-appreciated element in modern cooking.

## Steamer ##

### Steam Oven ###

### Steamer Basket ###

### Or, just steam-fry ###
