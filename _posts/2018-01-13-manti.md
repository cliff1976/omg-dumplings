## Ingredients ##

## Instructions ## 

## Pronunciation ##
See that character at the end of the word?  It's not a typical 'i'.  It's an 'ı' and it has a sound different from 'i' in Turkish.  It's more of a schwa (ə), which we like to think of as a sort of "generic vowel." <a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>

## Shout-outs ##

### [Lezizel](https://lezizel.de) ###
We first tried them in Munich, thanks to [Arts in Munich](https://www.artsinmunich.com).  We were overjoyed when they expanded to our town in Summer 2017.  They're still growing.  

### [Madan's](http://www.madans.de/) ###
A colleague with Turkish culinary smartz recommended this joint just outside our town.  Nominally a pizza place, they also have a whole section of their menu dedicated to *mantı*.  We've tried several varieties and have yet to be disappointed.
