Let's get one thing straight right away:  *Tamal* is the singular form.  Not *<em>tamale</em>.  Got it?

Here's what the finished product should look like (thanks Enrique!):

![vegetarian tamal with squash flower sauce]({{ "assets/img/veg_tamal.jpg" | absolute_url }})


[![banana leaf, smeared]({{ "assets/img/tamales/img_2644_100.jpg" | absolute_url }})]({{"assets/img/tamales/IMG_2644.jpg" | absolute_url }}) [![smeared and filled]({{ "assets/img/tamales/IMG_2649_100.jpg" | absolute_url }})]({{"assets/img/tamales/IMG_2649.jpg" | absolute_url }}) [![packages, tied up with string]({{ "assets/img/tamales/IMG_2648_100.jpg" | absolute_url }})]({{"assets/img/tamales/IMG_2648.jpg" | absolute_url }}) [![these are a few of my favorite things]({{ "assets/img/tamales/IMG_2656_100.jpg" | absolute_url }})]({{"assets/img/tamales/IMG_2656.jpg" | absolute_url }})


Let's try a caption.
