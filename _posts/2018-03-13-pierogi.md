## Dough ##

We stole some recipe ideas from around teh intarwebz.  Some from [Jenny Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYwHBG5A4uY), some from [Susan's Cooking School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKWl-njXhP0).  The dough seems just about as bland as possible:  

* flour
* water
* salt
* egg  
* sour cream

You mix.  You knead.  You let it rest.  You roll it out.  You cut it into circles.  You stuff the circles with the filling.  You boil those.  Then you either 
1. eat them, or 
1. fry them in a little oil to crispen them up.  

Hint:  it's #2.

## Russki ##
Cheese, potato, and onion.  Great for Lent, if you're into that.  Perhaps a few minced herbs and a dollop of sour cream, *Schmand*, *smântână*, or Greek-style yogurt to finish them off.

Some people serve them with bacon in them or on the side, but that's not strictly necessary (even if delicious).

## Mushroom ##
Really, there's more to it than than just that.  But not a lot more.

## Meaty ## 
Most frequently we've seen pork, or a beef-and-pork mixture.  Would be pleased see results based on poultry -- chicken, turkey, sheesh even duck?  

How about this:
1. Roast the duck, reserving the fat
2. Cube the duck meat
3. Fill up those pierogi with chopped roast duck and potato mash
3. Boil as per usual
3. Steam-fry 'em  in the duck fat
3. Die happy
