## Russki ##
Cheese, potato, and onion.  Great for Lent, if you're into that.  Perhaps a few minced herbs and a dollop of sour cream, *Schmand*, *smântână*, or Greek-style yogurt to finish them off.

Some people serve them with bacon in them or on the side, but that's not strictly necessary (even if delicious).

## Mushroom ##
Really, there's more to it than than just that.  But not a lot more.

## Meaty ## 
Most frequently we've seen pork, or a beef-and-pork mixture.  Would be pleased see results based on poultry -- chicken, turkey, sheesh even duck?  

How about this:
1. Roast the duck, reserving the fat
2. Cube the duck meat
3. Fill 'em up
3. Steam-fry the them rogues in the duck fat
3. Die happy
