- We generally prefer mass over volume (ooh, that's dense, right?) and often convert volume-based recipes we find on to mass-based measurements when we put our spin on them.

- We're pretty good at going back and forth between Celsius and Fahrenheit, so our recipes will probably list both.

- Spoons
    - "T" and "tbsp" mean "tablespoon"

    - "t" and "tsp" mean "teaspoon"
    
    C'mon -- you're not really going to weigh out 4.2 grams of chili powder or something, right?

- We won't make you wade through a whole backstory on a recipe like so many other food bloggers do.  That bugs.  We know what you're here for.  The backstory, if any, will come after any lists of ingredients, techniques and cooking notes.
