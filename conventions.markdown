- We generally prefer mass over volume (ooh, that's dense, right?) and often convert volume-based recipes to mass-based measurements

- We're pretty good at going back and forth between Celsius and Fahrenheit, so our recipes will probably list both 

- "T" and "tbsp." mean "tablespoon"

- "t" and "tsp" mean "teaspoon"

- We won't make you wade through a whole backstory on a recipe like so many other food bloggers do.  That bugs.  We know what you're here for.  The backstory will come after any lists of ingredients, techniques and cooking notes.
