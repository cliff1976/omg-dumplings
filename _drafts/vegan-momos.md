## Ingredients ## 
### Wrapper Dough ###
+ About 2 c flour
+ About 1/2 c water

Homemade dough is delicious and great for your sense of accomplishment, but if you can buy gyoza or wonton wrappers, go for it.  They're available frozen at our local Asian grocer.  Thaw them in the fridge before you get started.

### Filling ##
+ 5-6 leaves Napa cabbage (large center rib trimmed), torn
+ 5-6 dried Chinese mushrooms, rehydrated w/hot water (30 minutes), squeezed and quartered
+ 1 clove garlic, very roughly chopped
+ 1 in. fresh peeled ginger, very roughly chopped
+ 1 large onion, diced
+ 3 large carrots, peeled and shredded
+ 1-2 T vegetable oil
+ 1/8 t ground turmeric
+ salt and white pepper to taste

### Dipping Sauce ###
+ 1 t black vinegar
+ 2 T light soy sauce
+ 1 t Shao Xing wine
+ ½ t sugar
+ A few drops chili oil

## Instructions

1.  Fit food processor with blade attachment and add first 4 filling ingredients, chopping until pieces are fairly even in size. 

2.  Heat a large, deep skillet to medium and add oil. Cook onion until very tender, then add contents of food processor and carrots. Cook, stirring frequently, until well mixed and heated through. 

3.  Add turmeric, salt and pepper, stir well and taste, adjusting as needed. You will probably need to add salt a few times, just to make the veggies pop. You don’t want them to taste perceptibly salty, just like the most intense versions of themselves. The salt also serves to temper some of the carrots’ sweetness.

4.  Put a dollop of the filling mixture in the center of each dumpling wrapper (about 1½ t). Seal the edges of the dough around the meat filling and place on floured surface. Check the video below for dumpling wrapping help.

5.  To steam, place in steamer basket lined with cabbage leaves and don’t let the dumplings touch (they’ll stick to each other). Steam for 20-25 minutes. To steam-fry (suggested!), heat a large, deep skillet with an unvented lid and 1-2 T oil (we use sesame, but vegetable is fine) over medium-high. Add dumplings to pan, not letting them touch. Pour 2-3 T water into the pan (it will spit), cover with lid and cook 2-3 minutes (until browned). Turn dumplings and brown on other side, another 2-3 minutes. Cook in batches and add more oil and water as necessary. Always be conservative; you can always add more, but too much could ruin your dumplings.

6.  To prepare the dipping sauce, whisk all ingredients together in a small, deep bowl.

## The Backstory

We've never been to Nepal, but a local vegetarian friend of ours has.  She brought this recipe back with her, and we're bringing it to you.
